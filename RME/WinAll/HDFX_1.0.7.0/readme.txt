-------------

Latest driver:
http://www.rme-audio.com/download/hdspe_fx_win_xxx.zip


Latest firmware:
http://www.rme-audio.de/download/fut_hdspe_fx_win.zip


The firmware update is not possible unless the driver had been installed before.


Both driver installation and flash update are explained in detail in the manual!


*** First time installation of RME Audio Interfaces under Windows 7 ***

The procedure and instructions found in the manual are correct and stay valid, except for the start of the installation. In Windows 7 Microsoft removed the automatic start of the Driver Software Update dialog. Therefore this dialog has to be started manually after the failed driver installation.

- Hit the Win key, type 'Device Manager', start the Device Manager by selecting it from the list and hit Return.

- The device is shown with a yellow warning symbol. Usually it is already found in the correct category, Sound, Video and Game Controller (Plug & Play detects a multimedia device).

- Right click on the device and select 'Update Driver Software' from the context menu.

- The dialog 'Update Driver Software' appears. Now follow the instructions given in the manual.
